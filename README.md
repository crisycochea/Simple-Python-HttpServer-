# Simple-Python-HttpServer-
HTTPServer made with python. It handles every request with a TCP Server.

# Why did I do this?
Well, I wanted to make a talk about HTTP Protocol and how knowing that an HTTP Request is not only a dictionary or object that our framework give us can make us better coders. So, this was heavily inspired by [this PyCon talk](https://youtu.be/WqrCnVAkLIo).

Someday, I'm gonna include this in a talk.
